# Hello Coach!

This document lists the necessary steps to start your new _promo_. Delete it when you are done!

## How to use this repo?

This repository will be the main written communication channel with your promotion. Place here the briefings of your exercises, challenges and projects. Always keep it up to date, fix any error you find, and keep it well organized (a high-level folder structure is already provided).

As you progress with your promotion, you can draw exercises from the [Syllabus BeCodus repo](https://github.com/becodeorg/Syllabus-BeCodus) and/or from [Syllabus BeCodus Trello board](https://trello.com/b/DvmChbOG/syllabus-becodus-content).

**At the end of the promotion:**

1. Copy into **Syllabus BeCodus** any new exercise or challenge that you have created and that deserves to be used in the following promotions
2. Rename your repo and add `- archived` at the end. May it rest in peace.

## Steps to start your promo

1. [Duplicate](https://github.com/becodeorg/boilerplate-promo-en/generate) this repo and rename it according to the schema: `{campus}-{hero}-{counter}.{generation}` (Your <abbr title="Head of Campus">HOC</abbr> will give you the exact name, it will look something like: **gnt-yu-3-22**)
2. Update the `README.md` with the information specific to your promo (ðŸ‘‰ make sure you update everything surrounded by `{}`)
3. As soon as you can, update [The Watch](./Extra-Info/The-Watch.md) with the list of learners so they know when to prepare
4. Delete me! ðŸ™ˆ

Finally, you will find the most up-to-date guide with _all_ the information you need to start a new promo here: [First days of a new startup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17lEEyuNHS7VXBU-ZXa1FjUvr0I_XmZpAw0wnIvricJg/edit#).

## VoilÃ . Happy BeCoding !
