- Repository: `linear_regression_{YOUR-NAME-HERE}`
- Type of Challenge: `Learning` 
- Duration: `5 days`
- Deadline: `dd/mm/yy H:i AM/PM`
- Team challenge : Solo

## Learning Objectives
* Be able to identify linear problems.
* Be able to create a linear model, a multiple linear model and a polynomial model.
* Be able to work with matrices.
* Be able to understand a simple mathematical function.

## Deliverables
1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.
2. Pimp up the readme file:
	- What, Why, When, How, Who.
	- Pending things to do
