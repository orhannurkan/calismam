# Data Analysis

* Repository: `challenge-regression`
* Type of Challenge: `Consolidation`
* Duration: `3 days`
* Deadline: `24/11/2020 12:00` **(code)**
* Presentation: `24/11/2020 14:00`
* Team challenge : 4


## Mission objectives 
* Be able apply a linear regression in a real context
* Be able to preprocess data for machine learning

## The Mission
The real estate company "ImmoEliza" ask you to create a machine learning model to predict prices on Belgium's sales.

Take the dataset previously **scraped**, **preprocessed** and **analyzed**.
Preprocess the data to be used with machine learning.
* You have to handle NANs
* You have to handle categorical data
* You have to select features
* You have to remove features that have too strong correlation


### Must-have features
#### Step 1 : Data Cleaning**  
You have collected your data, you have cleaned and analyze it a first time! 
So it's time to do some machine learning with it! 

But first, we have to prepare the data for machine learning.

* No duplicates
* No NANs
* No text data
* No features that have too strong correlation between them

#### Step 2: Data formatting**  
Now that the dataset is ready, you have to format it for machine learning:
* Divide you `X` and your `y`
* Divide your dataset for training and testion. (`X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test`)


#### Step 3: Model selction**
The dataset is ready. Now let's select a model.

Look which model make the more sense according to your data.

#### Step 4: Apply your model!**
Apply your model on your data.


#### Step 5: Model evaluation**
Let's evaluate your model. Which accuracy did you reach?
Try to answer those questions:
* How could you improve this result?
* Which part of the process it have the more impact on the results?
* How should you divide your time working on this kind of project?


#### Step 4: Presentation**
Present your results in front of the group.
* You have to make a nice presentation **with a professinal design**.
* You have **5 minutes** to present (without Q&A). **You can't use more time**, **you can't use less time**.
* **Everyone have to talk** during the presentation.
* You **CAN'T show code or jupyter notebook** during the presentation.


## Deliverables
1. Pimp up the readme file:
	* What, Why, When, How, Who.
	* Pending things to do
2. Present your results in front of the group in **5mins max**.

### Steps
1. Create the repository
2. Study the request (What & Why ?)
3. Identify technical challenges (How ?)

## Evaluation criterias
| Criteria       | Indicator                                                                             | Yes/No |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 1. Is complete | Know how to answer all the above questions.                                           |   [ ]  |
|                | Use pandas and matplotlib/seaborn.                                                    |   [ ]  |
|                | Pimp up the readme. (what,why, how, who)                                              |   [ ]  |
|                | Your model predict					                                                 |   [ ]  |
|                | Present the results                               			                         |   [ ]  |
| 2. Is good     | The repo doesn't contains unnecessary files.                   			             |   [ ]  |
|                | You used typing.                                                			             |   [ ]  |
