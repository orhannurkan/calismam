    "# Chipotle clustering challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "- Repository: `clustering`\n",
    "- Type of Challenge: `Learning`\n",
    "- Duration: `1 day`\n",
    "- Deployment strategy :\n",
    "\t- Github page\n",
    "- Team challenge : `As you wish (max 4)`\n",
    "\t- visualization: 1\n",
    "\t- data analysis: 2\n",
    "\t- project management : 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives \n",
    "\n",
    "- visualization: to be able to use geopandas, matplotlib (and seaborn) to visualize clustered data onto a map\n",
    "- data analysis: to be able to determine appropriate clustering methods and variables to cluster \n",
    "- data analysis: to evaluate the chosen clustering method in comparison to other methods \n",
    "- project managment: to be able to allot the right amount of time for the tasks and present the results onto a readable github page\n",

    "Find chipotle **epicentres** to live your ideal chipotle lifestyle by clustering the [chipotle](chipotle_locations.csv) dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Must-have features\n",
    "\n",
    "- A visualisation of the USA with chipotle locations\n",
    "- Visualization of the different clusters\n",
    "- Intrinsic analysis comparison of the clusters of at least 2 methods with varying arguments (using euclidian distance as criteria)\n",
    "- A chosen centroid to live. Make your argument of why the chosen centroid is superior to others. Examples of arguments are:\n",
    "    - highest density\n",
    "    - greatest uninterrupted link of chipotle locations with smallest link-to-link distance\n",
    "    - ...\n",
    "- a Github page where results are visualized\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nice-to-have features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Colour coded cluster visualisation\n",
    "- Clear graph legends\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.\n",
    "2. Make a clear github page explaining your results and methods\n",
    "3. A chosen adress for the couple to live\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Create the repository\n",
    "2. Install geopandas\n",
    "3. Plot the [US map](https://jcutrer.com/python/learn-geopandas-plotting-usmaps)\n",
    "4. Visualize your data on this map\n",
    "5. Plot a [dendogram](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_agglomerative_dendrogram.html) of your data to help you decide the appropropriate clustering resolution\n",
    "6. Compare and analyse different [clustering methods](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html) using intrinsic analysis to decide on a chosen method.\n",
    "7. Choose a centroid/adress to live\n",
    "8. Publish your results to a Github page with an explanation of your method.\n",
