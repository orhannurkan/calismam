# Data Analysis

- Repository: `challenge-data-analysis`
- Type of Challenge: `Consolidation`
- Duration: `3 days`
- Deadline: `23/10/2020 17:00` **(code)**
- Presentation: `26/10/2020 9:00`
- Team challenge : 4


## Mission objectives 
- Be able to use pandas
- Be able to use Data visualisation libraries.(Matplotlib or Seaborn)
- Be able to establish conclusions about a dataset. 

## The Mission
The real estate company "ImmoEliza" wants to create a machine learning model to predict prices on Belgium's sales.

Take the dataset previously scraped. *(Centralize each group's dataset and merge then in 1 big dataset)*
You need to do a complete analysis and interpretation of the dataset. 


### Must-have features
**Step 1 : Data Cleaning**  
You have collected your data! So it's time to do a cleaning on it. A cleaned dataset is a dataset that doesn't contain any duplicate, is blank spaces or errors free. The rest of the analysis can be truncated if you neglect this step! 

- No duplicates
- No blank spaces (ex: ``" I love python  "`` =>  ``"I love python"``)
- No errors
- No empty values

**Step 2 : Data Analysis**  


Now that the data have been collected and cleaned, it is time for analysis. What is the target variable? How many variables and inputs do you have? 

Use the tools such as Matplotlib/Seaborn !

You must be able to answer :

- Which variable is the target ?
- How many rows and columns ?
- What is the correlation between variable/target ? (Why?)
- What is the correlation between the variables/variables ? (Why?)
- Which variables have the greatest influence on the target ?
- Which variables have the least influence on the target ?
- How many qualitative and quantitative variable is there ? How would you transform these values into numerical values ? 
- Percentage of missing values per column ?

**Step 3 : Data Interpretation**  

After analyzing your data, it's finally time to interpret your results. You have to communicate your analysis using simple words and a table or graph, then use the results to decide on your best course of action. 


Example of questions you should be able to answer to. *(Non-exhaustive list.) Try to make a maximum of interpretation of the dataset. 


You must be able to answer :

- Are there any outliers? If yes, which ones and why?
- Which variables would you delete and why ?
- In your opinion, which 5 variables are the most important and why?
- What are the most expensive municipalities in Belgium? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the most expensive municipalities in Wallonia? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the most expensive municipalities in Flanders? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the less expensive municipalities in Belgium? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the less expensive municipalities in Wallonia? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the less expensive municipalities in Flanders? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)

**Step 4: Presentation**
Present your results in front of the group.
- You have to make a nice presentation **with a professinal design**.
- You have **5 minutes** to present (without Q&A). **You can't use more time**, **you can't use less time**.
- **Everyone have to talk** during the presentation.
- You **CAN'T show code or jupyter notebook** during the presentation.
- Presentations will happens on **Monday 26** online.

**Bonus :**  
- In your opinion, which model of machine learning could solve and why?

## Deliverables
1. Pimp up the readme file:
	- What, Why, When, How, Who.
	- Pending things to do
2. Present your results in front of the group in **5mins max**.

### Steps
1. Create the repository
2. Study the request (What & Why ?)
3. Identify technical challenges (How ?)

## Evaluation criterias
| Criteria       | Indicator                                                                             | Yes/No |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|

|                | Present the results                               			                         |        |
| 2. Is good     | The repo doesn't contains unnecessary files.                   			             |        |
|                | You used typing.                                                			             |        |
|                | The presentation is clean.                                   			             |        |
