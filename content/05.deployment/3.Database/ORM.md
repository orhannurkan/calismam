# Work with ORM for databases

## What is an ORM?
"O.R.M." stands for **O**bjectâ€“**R**elational **M**apping.
This a way to interact with your database. 

## The good old way
The classical way would be to write a query on server side (in your flask API for example) and to send it to the DB.

Let's take an example in MySQL:

First, you would write a query in a string or a formatted string, then you would send it to your db:
```python
# Import MySQL libraries
from mysql.connector import MySQLConnection, Error

def query_with_fetchone():
    # Wrap the query in a try/except to avoid your server to crash
    try:
        # get the config info from your DB
        dbconfig = "CONFIG HERE..."
        # Open a connexion
        conn = MySQLConnection(**dbconfig)
        # Open a cursor
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        # Define your query
        query = "SELECT * FROM books"
        # Use the cursor to execute a query
        cursor.execute(query)
        # Get all the row your received from your DB
        row = cursor.fetchone()
        
        # Loop over the rows
        while row is not None:
            # Print the row
            print(row)
            # Remove the row from the cursor (consume it)
            row = cursor.fetchone()
    # Handle errors
    except Error as e:
        print(e)
    # Error or not, when it's done, cluse the cursor and the connexion with the DB
    finally:
        cursor.close()
        conn.close()

# Run the code
if __name__ == '__main__':
    query_with_fetchone()
```

## Why using ORM then?
Well, this code will do the job, but here are some disadvantages:

1. As you can see you have to write a lot of code and to handle a lot of errors, to remember to close the cursor for each request, to close the connexion when you are done,...

2. You are exposed to SQL injections if you are using SQL, you have to think about security when you want to handle big queries you will have to have a really good knowledge of the query language you are using, and finally, you have to know every good practice to be sure to write something that is optimized (a bad query can take ages to run!).

3. You could send a bad typed data, if you insert a row or replace the content of it, you could send a string where the DB expects an int for example. In the case of a SQL database, it will return your and error (you will have to handle it) so it's not a big deal during development. But if you are working with a no-SQL database, it will just execute the query and do it. Great, no error, but when you will need to use this data that you expect to be an int and receive a string, you will have a lot of issues, unclear errors, hours of debugging your code when the problem come from the data,... Believe me, it happens faster than you think and it's a real pain...

## What is ORM exactly?
Ok, now that we know we want to use something better, how do these ORM work?

1. You declare a schema for your data. Let's say that I have a Book table in my DB and I want to have an ID field (int and primary key), a `title` that is a string, and a `number_of_pages` which is an int. I could declare my schema like that:

```python
# Import what we need
from sqlalchemy import Column, String, Integer
from base import Base

# Example with mongoDB and SQL alchimy
class Book(Base):
    # You provide the name of the table in my DB
    __tablename__ = 'books'
    # You set an ID field 
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    # You set a title field 
    title = Column('title', String(32))
    # You set an number of pages field 
    number_of_pages=Column('number_of_pages', Integer)

    # Add an init method that will allow you to easily create a new entry later.
    def __init__(self, title: str, number_of_pages: int):
        self.title = title
        self.number_of_pages = number_of_pages
```

*It will, of course, change depending on the ORM library you use.*

2. Now that your typed data is defined you can easily add a `Book` in your DB:
```python
from base import Session, engine, Base

# 1. generate database schema
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

# 2. create a new session (a connexion with the dabation)
session = Session()

# 3. create a new book
my_new_book = Book(title="Resilient Management", number_of_page="234")

# 4. Prepare the query and add it to the "commit" (so you can save a lot of queries and execute them all as once)
session.add(my_new_books)

# 5. execute all the operations stored and execute them as one big optimized query.
session.commit()
# 6. Close the session
session.close()
```

Ok, it's will verbose but at least everything will be secured and optimize, and you will see, it's not the only advantage.

3. You want to get all the books in the DB? Super simple:
```python
from base import Session

# Create a session
session = Session()
# Create the query (can be heavly tweaked to filter only what you need)
books = session.query(Book).all()

# That's it! All your books are stored in `books`
for book in books:
    print(f{title: {book.title} number of pages: book.number_of_pages})
```

## Complex stuff
Ok those examples was easy, but those libraries are super powerful, you can manage the relation between two tables, add conditions, auto-format fields, and SOOOOOO much more.

## Do I NEED to know ORMs?
Definitely. First, because it's amazing but mainly because a lot of libraries use it by default (Django for example) and if you have to work with these, you will need to know how to properly use ORMs.

## Conclusion
ORM is super useful and powerful, you will "loose" sometime when you will have to define each schema but when it's done, you will work super fast with the conviction that you can't really do any harm to your database.


## Popular libraries to work with ORMs in python
* MongoDB: [Mangoose and PyMongo](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-mongodb-and-python/)
* SQL based DB: [SQL Alchemy](https://auth0.com/blog/sqlalchemy-orm-tutorial-for-python-developers/)
* Complete one: [Pony ORM](https://ponyorm.org/)
* Django: [Django ORM](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/queries/)

## Side notes
To access certain types of DB the ORM will need a "connector", a library to connect the ORM and the database, depending on the database you are using you will have to install it to, for more information about that, please read the documentation of the ORM you are using.

Some ORM can be slower than a super well written query (we are talking here about optimization for production). But a lot of big companies use ORMs anyway, don't worry that's already super fast, it's rare to need to optimize your code that much!

## Final notes
I hope you have a clear idea of what is ORMs, if it's not the case, contact your team and talk about it with them.

To properly use an ORM you will need to do more research, don't limit yourself to what I wrote in this readme, I only saw a half of the basis.

ORM is amazing and will make you win sooooo much time when you will master them, believe me on this one! ;)
