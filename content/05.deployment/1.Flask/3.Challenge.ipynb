    "# PROJECT: Flask API\n",
    "\n",
    "![Lazy picture](./assets/lazy.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Repository: `challenge-flask-api`\n",
    "- Type of Challenge: `Learning`\n",
    "- Duration: `3 days`\n",
    "- Deadline: `dd/mm/yy H:i AM/PM`\n",
    "- Deployment strategy :\n",
    "\t- Heroku\n",
    "\n",
    "- Team challenge : `solo`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "You will learn how to create an API in Python with the Flask module.\n",
    "At the end of the challenge, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Create a Flask app\n",
    "- Add a route that shows hello world\n",
    "- Add a route with GET method\n",
    "- Add a route with POST method\n",
    "- Get data from a GET request, transorm it and return it\n",
    "- Get data from a POST request, transorm it and return it\n",
    "- Deploy your API on Heroku\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Mission\n",
    "You are an intern in a company to provide AI models to their customers. Unfortunatly, the machine learning engineers that work with you are not very good...\n",
    "They spend more time drinking coffee and playing video games than doing their job. After a few weeks, the project manager comes to you and tells you that they have a client that is really upset to not have his model yet. He asks you to create the API to get the data and return a random prediction. It will give him more time to beg the ML engineers to finish the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "You decide to use Flask as it's the best tool to boostrap an API in python.\n",
    "You receive a mail from the client:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Dear lazy company,\n",
    "WE NEED OUR MODEL TO BE READY BY TOMORROW OR YOU WILL BE IN TROUBLE!!!\n",
    "OUR LAWYERS ARE READY TO SUE YOU!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test your API in 48h.\n",
    "You will find in attachment the routes that should be working (AND I HOPE FOR YOU THEY WILL):\n",
    "\n",
    "Kind regards,\n",
    "Your lovely client,\n",
    "MadCompany\n",
    "```\n",

    "#### Attachments:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Route to check if the server runs\n",
    "GET /status -> \"Alive!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Route to login\n",
    "POST /login -> \"Login success for user {USER_NAME_HERE} with password of length: {PASSWORD_LENGTH_HERE}!\"\n",
    "body: {\n",
    "    username: <USER_NAME_HERE>\n",
    "    password: <PASSWORD_HERE>\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Route that returns the prediction\n",
    "GET /predict/<seller_avaible:int>/<month:str>/<customer_visiting_website:int> -> Prediction (int between 2000 and 5000)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Must-have features\n",
    "- A `GET` route at `/status` that returns the string \"alive\"\n",
    "- A `POST` route at `/login` that returns a string containing \"Login success for user `USER_NAME_HERE` with password of length: `PASSWORD_LENGTH_HERE`!\".\n",
    "- A `GET` route at `/predict` that takes 3 arguments (`month`, `customer_visiting_website`, `seller_available`) and returns an int between `2000` and `5000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nice-to-have features\n",
    "- Folow pep8 rules.\n",
    "- Add a docstring for each route.\n",
    "- Use type hints in all your functions.\n",
    "- Use the `Black` formatter to format your code.\n",
    "- Add a route that takes an image and saves it on the server. Return the image's server path.\n",
    "- Add unit tests for at least one route.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Miscellaneous information\n",
    "Feel free to play with Flask and add your own routes!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.\n",
    "2. Wrap your API in a Docker container.\n",
    "3. Deploy it on Heroku.\n",
    "4. Pimp up the README file:\n",
    "\t- What, Why, When, How, Who.\n",
    "\t- Pending things to do\n",
    "\t- It must contain a link to the \"live\" version. The \"live\" version must contain a link to the source code on GitHub.\n",
    "5. Publish the link to the \"live\" version on your startup's Ryver channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Create the repository.\n",
    "2. Study the request (What & Why ?)\n",
    "3. Identify technical challenges (How ?)\n",
    "4. ULM prototype.\n",
    "5. Design your API.\n",
    "6. Create a Docker file to auto-run you API.\n",
    "7. Deploy it on Heroku.\n",
