- Repository: `challenge-card-game-becode`

- Team challenge : `solo`

## Mission objectives

## Learning Objectives
- Make a good usage of classes.
- Use Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
- Use imports in a clean way.
- Use a clean architecture.
- Structure a project.
- Go deeper in object inheritance. 

## The Mission
You apply for a job as a developper for an online casino called `WeTakeYourMoney`. 

They are interested in your profile.
As an interview challenge they ask you to build a card game in Python.

### Must-have features
- The game is working until each player doesn't have any cards left.
- The game generates all the cards.
- The game distributes all the cards.


### Nice-to-have features
- Make the game interactive, at each turn, ask to the player which card he/her wants to play.
- Create gameover conditions and add the possibiliy in the game to end because of the aforementioned conditions.
- Add points for each player if the card is the most `powerful` card played that turn.
- Select a winner out of the players at the end of the game.

### Contraints
#### Imports
```python
# You CAN'T import like this:
import whathever_file
# You CAN'T import like this:
import .whathever_file
# You CAN'T import like this:
from .whathever_file.whathever_function
# You CAN'T import like this:
from .whathever_function
# You CAN'T import like this:
from whathever_file
```

```python
# You CAN import like this:
from whathever_file import whathever_function_or_class
```

#### Code style
- Each **class** should have a [`__str__()` method](https://medium.com/swlh/understanding-repr-and-str-in-python-65dd41538943). 
- Each **function or class** has to be **typed**
- Each **function or class** has to contain a **docstring** formatted like this:
```python
def add(number_one: int, number_two: int) -> int:
    """
    Function that will perform the add operation between two numbers (in params).
    
    :param number_one: An int that will be added to the second parameter.
    :param number_two: An int that will be added to the fist parameter.
    :return: An int that is the result of the two params being added to each other.
    """
    result = number_one + number_two
    return result
```
- Your code should be **formatted** with [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/).
- Your code should be **commented**.
- Your code should be **cleaned of any commented unused code**.

#### Repo
- Your repo should only contain the files specified.
- Your README should be nice and complete (what, why, how, who). Feel free to add more information.

### Steps
#### 0. preparation
Create a github repo called `challenge-card-game-becode`. In this repository create 2 files:
- `README.md`
- `main.py`

And a folder:
- `utils`

In the `utils` folder create 3 files:
- `card.py`
- `player.py`
- `game.py`

You're ready to go!


#### 1. A simple card
##### 1.1 Symbol
In `card.py`:

Create a class called `Symbol` with two attributes:
- `color` which is a string.
- `icon` which is a string: `[♥, ♦, ♣, ♠]`

##### 1.2 Card
In the same file, create a class `Card` that **inherits** from `Symbol` and add an attribute:
- `value` which is a string. *(it can be 'A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K')*


#### 2. A bunch of players
In `player.py` creat a class `Player` that contains these attributes:
- `cards` which is a list of `Card`. *(you will need to import `Card` from `card.py`)*.
- `turn_count` which is an int starting a 0.
- `number_of_cards` which is an int starting at 0.
- `history` which is a list of `Card` that will contain all the cards played by the player.

And some methods:
- `play()` that will: 
    - **randomly** pick a `Card` in `cards`.
    - Add the `Card` to the `Player`'s `history`.
    - Print: `{PLAYER_NAME} {TURN_COUNT} played: {CARD_NUMBER} {CARD_SYMBOL_ICON}`.
    - return the `Card`.
    


#### 3. A complete deck
Create a `Deck` class that contains:
- An attribute `cards` which is gonna contain a list of instances of `Card`.
- A `fill_deck()` method that will fill `card()` with a complete card game *(an instance of  'A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K' for each possible symbol [♥, ♦, ♣, ♠])*. Your deck should contain **52 cards at the end**.
- A `shuffle()` method that will shuffle all the `Card` instances of `cards`.
- A `distribute()` that will take a list of `Player` as parameter and will distribute the cards evenly between all the players.

#### 4. A board
In `game.py` create:

A class called `Board` that contains:
- An attribute `players` that is a list of `Player`. It will contain all the players that are playing.
- An attribute `turn_count` that is an int.
- An attribute `active_cards` that will contain the last card played by each player.
- An attribute `history_cards` that will contains all the card played except the `active_cards`.
- A method `start_game()` that will:
    - Starts the game, 
    - Fill a `Deck`, 
    - Distribute the cards of the `Deck` to the players.
    - Make each `Player` `play()` a `Card` , where each player should only play 1 card per turn, and all players have to play at each turn until they have no card left.
    - At the end of each turn, print:
        - The turn count.
        - The list of active cards.
        - The number of cards in the `history_cards`.
        
#### 5. Let's play!
In `main.py`:
- import everything you need to start the game!
- Start the game. You should only run this file to have the game running.


## Deliverables
1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.
2. Pimp up the readme file:
	- What, Why, When, How, Who.
	- Pending things to do
