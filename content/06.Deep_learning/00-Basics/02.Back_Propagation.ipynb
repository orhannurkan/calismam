    "# Back Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick summary of what a neural network is :\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is a group of connected I/O units where each connection has a weight associated with its computer programs. It helps you to build predictive models from large databases. This model builds upon the human nervous system. It helps you to conduct image understanding, human learning, computer speech, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Backpropagation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Back-propagation is the essence of neural net training. It is the method of fine-tuning the weights of a neural net based on the error rate obtained in the previous epoch (i.e., iteration). Proper tuning of the weights allows you to reduce error rates and to make the model reliable by increasing its generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation is a short form for \"backward propagation of errors.\" It is a standard method of training artificial neural networks. This method helps to calculate the gradient of a loss function with respects to all the weights in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Backpropagation Works: Simple Algorithm \n",
    "Consider the following diagram :\n",
    "\n",
    "![back propagation](./img/back.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inputs X, arrive through the preconnected path\n",
    "2. Input is modeled using real weights W. The weights are usually randomly selected.\n",
    "3. Calculate the output for every neuron from the input layer, to the hidden layers, to the output layer.\n",
    "4. Calculate the error in the outputs\n",
    "5. Travel back from the output layer to the hidden layer to adjust the weights such that the error is decreased.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Why We Need Backpropagation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most prominent advantages of Backpropagation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Backpropagation is fast, simple and easy to program\n",
    "- It has no parameters to tune apart from the numbers of input\n",
    "- It is a flexible method as it does not require prior knowledge about the network\n",
    "- It is a standard method that generally works well\n",
    "- It does not need any special mention of the features of the function to be learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Feed Forward Network?\n",
    "A feedforward neural network is an artificial neural network where the nodes never form a cycle. This kind of neural network has an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. It is the first and simplest type of artificial neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Backpropagation Networks\n",
    "Two Types of Backpropagation Networks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Static Back-propagation\n",
    "- Recurrent Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static back-propagation:\n",
    "It is one kind of backpropagation network which produces a mapping of a static input for static output. It is useful to solve static classification issues like optical character recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recurrent Backpropagation:\n",
    "Recurrent backpropagation is fed forward until a fixed value is achieved. After that, the error is computed and propagated backward.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between both of these methods is: that the mapping is rapid in static back-propagation while it is nonstatic in recurrent backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backpropagation Key Points \n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplifies the network structure by elements weighted links that have the least effect on the trained network\n",
    "- You need to study a group of input and activation values to develop the relationship between the input and hidden unit layers.\n",
    "- It helps to assess the impact that a given input variable has on a network output. The knowledge gained from this analysis should be represented in rules.\n",
    "- Backpropagation is especially useful for deep neural networks working on error-prone projects, such as image or speech recognition.\n",
    "- Backpropagation takes advantage of the chain and power rules allows backpropagation to function with any number of outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of using Backpropagation\n",
    "- The actual performance of backpropagation on a specific problem is dependent on the input data.\n",
    "- Backpropagation can be quite sensitive to noisy data\n",
    "- You need to use the matrix-based approach for backpropagation instead of mini-batch.\n",
